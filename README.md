# SmallProjects
Old smaller projects from courses at LSU.

- This is a collection of some old projects and programs from my courses at LSU.
  These are the ones that I was able to find. It includes some different heap
  structures and sorting algorithms. It also includes some parser/interpreter
  work. There is tree work and matrix multiplication as well. If there are any
  questions about the work then you can contact me at rshoul2@gmail.com.
